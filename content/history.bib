In the letter, Gates expressed frustration with most computer hobbyists who were using his company's Altair {BASIC} software without having paid for it. He asserted that such widespread unauthorized copying in effect discouraged developers from investing time and money in creating high-quality software. He cited the unfairness of gaining the benefits of software authors' time, effort, and capital without paying them as a rationale for refusing to publish the machine code for his company's flagship product, thereby making it available to lower-income hobbyists who could have borrowed such program listings from their local library and entered the program into their hobby computer by data entry.},

	abstract = {Apple Computer, Inc. v. Franklin Computer Corp., 714 F.2d 1240 (3d Cir. 1983), was the first time an appellate level court in the United States held that a computer's {BIOS} could be protected by copyright. As second impact, this ruling clarified that binary code, the machine readable form of software and firmware, was copyrightable too and not only the human-readable source code form of software.Franklin Computer Corporation introduced the Franklin Ace 1000, a clone of Apple Computer's Apple {II}, in 1982. Apple quickly determined that substantial portions of the Franklin {ROM} and operating system had been copied directly from Apple's versions, and on May 12, 1982, filed suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. It cited the presence of some of the same embedded strings, such as the name "James Huston" (an Apple programmer), and "Applesoft," on both the Apple and Franklin system disks.
Franklin admitted that it had copied Apple's software but argued that it would have been impractical to independently write its own versions of the software and maintain compatibility, although it said it had written its own version of Apple's copy utility and was working on its own versions of other software. Franklin argued that because Apple's software existed only in machine-readable form, and not in printed form, and because some of the software did not contain copyright notices, it could be freely copied. The Apple {II} firmware was likened to a machine part whose form was dictated entirely by the requirements of compatibility (that is, an exact copy of Apple's {ROM} was the only part that would "fit" in an Apple-compatible computer and enable its intended function), and was therefore not copyrightable.
The district court found in favor of Franklin.  However, Apple appealed the ruling to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit which, in a separate case decided three days after Franklin won at the lower level, had determined that both a program existing only in a written form unreadable to humans (e.g. object code) and one embedded on a {ROM} were protected by copyright. (See Williams Elec., Inc., v. Artic Int'l, Inc., 685 F.2d 870 (1982)).  The Court of Appeals overturned the district court's ruling in Franklin by applying its holdings in Williams and going further to hold that operating systems were also copyrightable. The Court remanded the case to the District Court for a determination regarding whether Apple's operating system was one of a very limited number of ways to achieve its function. If it was, then Franklin would not be liable for copyright infringement. The parties settled.
Apple was able to force Franklin to withdraw its clones by 1988. The company later brought non-infringing clones to market, but as these models were only partially compatible with the Apple {II}, and as the Apple {II} architecture was by this time outdated in any case, they enjoyed little success in the marketplace.
{IBM} believed that some {IBM} {PC} clone makers such as Eagle Computer and Corona Data Systems similarly infringed on its copyright, and after Apple v. Franklin successfully forced them to stop using the {BIOS}. The Phoenix {BIOS} in 1984, however, and similar products such as {AMI} {BIOS}, permitted computer makers to legally build essentially 100\% {PC}-compatible clones without having to reverse engineer the {PC} {BIOS} themselves.Another impact of the decision was the rise of the shrink-wrap proprietary software commercial business model, where before a source code driven software distribution schema dominated.},

In a review in The Guardian, Stephen Poole wrote that the open source movement might have the effect of reducing the price people are willing to pay for other products. He also highlighted the inconsistency between the free cost of open source and the price the publishers were asking for the book.Chris Douce wrote that the book is an "important addition to the genre of writing that will undoubtedly become termed 'pop-computing'". He also wrote that the book raised interesting questions regarding the relationship between technology and culture, as lot of early design decisions about the Linux kernel were determined by microprocessors.Sean Jewett wrote that "Rebel Code, despite some flaws, is a must read for those using Linux. It helps put into perspective the decisions that were made early on, and sheds light on the revolution to come."},
